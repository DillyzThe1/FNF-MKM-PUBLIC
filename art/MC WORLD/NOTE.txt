These are the untouched Minecraft world files from December 6th, 2019.
They were generated on my computer for an old video on That1LazerBoi's channel, as I had to do the recording for both Minecraft and Gmod.
This world was made on 1.14.4, but has been opened on versions 1.16.4, 1.18.2, & 1.19.2 on a cloned variant for making MKM a real thing.
Once again, 1.14.4 is what you'd generate a world with the seed on, and this is the untouched version from when it was generated for the video.

No, I don't delete Minecraft worlds that often. Yes I have played thousands and lost hundreds.




You may use this world for MKM fan content or exploration.
